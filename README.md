# Dynamic Image Slider

An interactive and responsive image slider using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project features smooth transitions, navigation controls, and optional enhancements such as thumbnail navigation, captions, and touch/swipe support.


## Objective

The objective of this project is to create a dynamic image slider that showcases different images with smooth transitions, providing an engaging and interactive user experience.

## Project Description

This image slider displays multiple images in a rotating fashion. The slider includes navigation controls to move between images and is responsive, adapting smoothly to different screen sizes. You can use any set of images you prefer.

## Key Features

- **HTML Structure:** Create a container for the image slider and include placeholders for images and navigation controls.
- **CSS Styling:** Style the slider container and images, add transitions and animations for smooth sliding effects, and ensure responsiveness for various screen sizes.
- **JavaScript Functionality:** Implement the logic for navigating between images, add functionality for auto-sliding images at a set interval, and handle user interactions with navigation controls (e.g., previous/next buttons).

## Enhancements

- **Thumbnail Navigation:** Add a row of thumbnails below the main image slider, allowing users to click on a thumbnail to view the corresponding image.
- **Caption and Description:** Include a caption or description for each image, displayed dynamically as the images change.
- **Touch/Swipe Support:** Implement touch/swipe functionality for mobile devices to enhance user interaction.
- **Fade Transitions:** Use fading transitions for a different visual effect instead of sliding.
- **Responsive and Modern:** Design is responsive, works well on different screen sizes and aims for a clean, modern look.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** To create the structure of the image slider.
- **CSS:** To style the slider and add animations and transitions.
- **JavaScript:** To implement the functionality for navigating between images and handling user interactions.
